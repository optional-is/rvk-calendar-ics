# RVK Calendar ICS

This is a showcase project intended to demonstrate some of the things you can do with the calender API.

This has two parts, a scraper and converter. The scraper fetchs the data from the Calendar API and the converter converts it from JSON into an ICS file which can be using in outlook or other calendaring apps.
